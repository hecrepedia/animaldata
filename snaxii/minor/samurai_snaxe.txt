<p>These Snaxii have lived in isolation every since their debut a few
 hundred thousand years ago. On the islands of Japan, these Snaxii
 train rigorously in the art of the Samurai, maxing out their defense,
 strength, and sword stats. They also like to play football, also known
 as soccer some weird country that doesn't call it football.</p>
[Personality]

 bulky armor. They are mortal enemies with the Ninja Snaxii, always
 in constant war with them, since they are the two most common
 species in Japan. Be careful, they can arrest you.
