[Bio]
<p>These Snaxii have lived in isolation every since their debut a few
 hundred thousand years ago. On the islands of Japan, these Snaxii
 train rigorously in the art of the Ninja, maxing out their sneak,
 stealth, and assassination stats. They also like to play baseball.</p>
[Personality]
<p>Just like ninjas, these Snaxii are hard to be seen, because they
 are shy. They are mortal enemies with the Samurai Snaxii, always
 in constant war with them, since they are the two most common
 species in Japan. Be careful, they can slither like snakes (I
 mean, all Snaxii can, but they are cool).</p>

 a researcher to confirm this information).</p>
[Fun Facts]

 based of them. A famous work based of the Ninja Snaxe is
