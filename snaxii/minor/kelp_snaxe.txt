[Bio]
<p>Sushi masters looking for the best seaweed underwater must beware of this
 species. These are not edible, if you eat them, then they will probably eat
 you from the inside out. If you are a Hecretary Bird reading this, then
 you should be fine.</p>
[Personality]
<p>They like to sway in the wind, just like trees. What? Did I say wind,
 I meant waves. They like to sway in the waves, and like long naps at
 the beach. Or that is at least what they nap about, they are immobile.</p>
[History]
<p>Some fools in the past thought that this was a rare delicacy that tasted
 so good, you would never be able to taste anything like it again. The latter
 half is true, the first is wrong.</p>
[Fun Facts]
<p>Kids in school like to research this Snaxe because when they have to act it
 out, it is very easy to do this one.</p>
