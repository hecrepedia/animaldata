[Bio]
<p>A bird? Nay. A plane? It's a Balloon Snaxe, and probably not superman.
 You can tell by it's appearance that this Snaxe has the ability to
 shape-shift. What makes this Snaxe so deadly is that it has evolved to
 target young children. Do not fret, the ease of remove of these Snaxii
 is fitting for their rarity. Some get caught up in the wrong end of a
 science experiment, some never get inflated. Just keep a safety pin
 with you at all times, and you too can be like Big Shaq when you make
 the Balloon Snaxii go Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop!</p>

 Snaxe forms, fall back down, and see who is the last one that turns
 back into a balloon.</p>
[History]

 whenever they fell like it. Gosh darn Balloon Snaxii.</p>
