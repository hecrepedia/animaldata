<p>All Bearded Snaxii have a split personality.
 One can usually predict the personality of the Snaxe, but no one can predict the personality of the beard.</p>
 <h1>Snaxe</h1>
 <hr>
 <p>The Snaxe, if you may, of a Bearded Snaxe tend to be socially shy with other species and prefer hanging around with each other.
  For some unknown reasons, these Snaxii like to wage war agaisnt crows at
  local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costco" target="_blank">Costcos</a>, which can lead to people thinking that it's night already.
  When these Snaxii are not warriors, they prefer to just exist and not do anything. The conflict of their personality is what lands
  them in the moderately dangerous category. They are also very stylish, and can be compared to
  <a href="http://splatoon.wikia.com/wiki/Inklings" target="_blank">Inklings</a> from

<h1>Beard</h1>
<hr>
<p>The beard is mysterious and unique to the Bearded Snaxii. It has a mind of its own and is very agressive.
 So agressive are they, that the Bearded Snaxii have invented a special muzzle for their beards, but their laziness prevents
 them from using it. It is very rare, if not impossible, to see a Bearded Snaxe that has a good relationship with its beard.
 Many of the beards of the Bearded Snaxii like to forcefully lift their masters into the sky,
 which is why Bearded Snaxii are great warriors, since they know how to channel their anger. Beards of the Bearded Snaxii
 are not afraid, even of being shaved. This is because they cannot be shaved. (This remains true for a female Bearded Snaxe)</p>
[History]
<p>We do not know much of the history of Beard Snaxii. We can assume that before the Snaxii banded together as one force,
 they must've been rivals with the Balloon Snaxii.</p>
[Fun Facts]
<p>Technically, these Snaxii just have a slightly broken levitate ability, and don't actually have the power of flight.</p>
