[History]
<p>About 36,000 years after the initial branching of the Snaxe
 Evolutionary Tree, the world started to heat up. The ice caps
 melted and sea levels rose. Some snaxii who lived in coastal
 areas had to deal with heavy rain and flooding and therefore
 developed adaptations to live underwater. The first of these
 water snaxii, the Generic Water Snaxe, was the direct ancestor
 of the Common Sea Snaxe.</p>
