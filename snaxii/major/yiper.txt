Yiper
[Pronunciation]
/yeye-puhr/
[Rarity]
Major
[Powers]
[Bio]
<p>A being of great power, enough to destroy cities and definitely much more.
 Whilst being a Major Snaxe, this is the only one with the power that rivals
 the Evil Snaxe. It can summon devastating storms, but is currently hiding
 so that it won't draw attention to itself and prepare for a massive attack.
 Unfortunately for us, its plan will most likely work because the Yiper
 does not have hands, it cannot draw.</p>
[Personality]
<p>This reclusive Snaxe is very scary. It has learned how to become invisible
 by standing so still, an ability only shared by the great Drax from the MCU.
 It attacks are very quick, it can destroy 1,000 cities faster than Thanos
 could snap them away.</p>
[History]
<p>Other than being formed at the same time as the original Major Snaxii,
 we don't currently have anything yet, and we doubt that it would be
 mentioned in the Magnitudo, since the power of the creatures in Magnitude
 would make the Yiper seem like a fly to them. And the Yiper doesn't even
 have wings!</p>
[Fun Facts]
<p>The only current picture of Yiper that we have as has its name inscribed
 in the ancient and truest language, Anglish.</p>
